**************************************
Cloud-based LSST software distribution
**************************************

In this document you will find information on a service designed so that you can use a binary distribution of the `LSST science pipelines <https://pipelines.lsst.io>`_ on your personal computer without actually installing the software.

As a user of this distribution mechanism, **stable and weekly releases** of the LSST software appear as if they were locally installed on your computer under the path  ``/cvmfs/sw.lsst.eu``. Since new releases just appear there without you to take any action, you can focus on using the software, instead on the technicalities of installing and updating it regularly.

Visit the :ref:`overview` to get more details on the benefits and intended audience of this service brought to the `LSST community <https://community.lsst.org>`_  by `LSST-France <http://www.lsst.fr>`_ and `CC-IN2P3 <https://cc.in2p3.fr>`_.

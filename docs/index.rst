**************************************
Cloud-based LSST software distribution
**************************************
 
In this document you will find information on a service designed so that you can use a binary distribution of the `LSST science pipelines <https://pipelines.lsst.io>`_ on your personal computer without actually installing the software.
 
As a user of this distribution mechanism, **stable and weekly releases** of the LSST software appear as if they were locally installed on your computer under the path ``/cvmfs/sw.lsst.eu``. Since new releases just appear there without you to take any action, you can focus on using the software, instead on the technicalities of installing and updating it regularly.

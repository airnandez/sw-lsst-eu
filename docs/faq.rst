How many releases of the LSST software do you plan to keep available online?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our current policy is to keep online **all the stable releases** and at least the **latest 12 weekly releases** officially issued by the LSST project.

Even if older than 12 weeks, specific weekly releases identified by the community as necessary for reproducibility purposes are also kept online. We call them *pinned releases*. The list of pinned weekly releases can be found `here <https://github.com/airnandez/sw-lsst-eu/issues/3>`_.

.. warning::

	Please be aware that **non-pinned, obsolete weekly releases will be removed without notice**. You are therefore encouraged to use a recent weekly release at any time or to stick to a stable release, if you don't need the latest features of the pipelines.

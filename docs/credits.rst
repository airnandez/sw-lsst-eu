This work is a contribution to the worldwide `LSST community <https://community.lsst.org>`_  by `LSST-France <http://www.lsst.fr>`_. The web server infrastructure is hosted and operated by `CC-IN2P3 <https://cc.in2p3.fr>`_.

The continous delivery infrastructure of this web site was set up and is maintained by **Bertrand Rigaud**. **Vanessa Hamar** manages CC-IN2P3's CernVM-FS servers infrastructure and **Fabio Hernandez** takes care of building the LSST software, packaging it for distribution and continously improving this documentation.

For bringing this service to you we leverage the work done by the `LSST Data Management <https://www.lsst.org/about/dm>`_ and CERN's `CernVM-FS <https://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem>`_ teams.

Get the LSST science pipelines delivered to your computer
*********************************************************

Here you will find information on how to get a binary distribution of the `LSST Science Pipelines <https://pipelines.lsst.io>`_  of the the `Vera C. Rubin Observatory <https://rubinobservatory.org>`_ distributed to your personal computer, without building and installing the software yourself.

As a user of this software distribution service, both **stable and weekly releases** of the LSST software appear as if they were locally installed on your computer. Since **new releases just appear under the local path** ``/cvmfs/sw.lsst.eu`` **without you to take any action**, you can focus on using the software, instead of on the technicalities of installing and updating it regularly.

Visit the :ref:`overview` to get more details on the benefits and intended audience of this service brought to the `LSST community <https://community.lsst.org>`_  by `LSST-France <http://www.lsst.fr>`_ and `CNRS / IN2P3 computing center <https://cc.in2p3.fr>`_ (CC-IN2P3).
